And when you touch both the extremes and the core, you really are touching the whole thing and thus I was wholly me.</p><p>The second question was a challenge to not get stuck on one idea, one angle, one thought. There were always more thoughts coming around the corner. Ideas never come alone, they come together. If you&rsquo;re precious with one idea and don&rsquo;t let it breathe, you don&rsquo;t know what ideas it was coming with. So I let the weird flow, becoming a real audience to my own writing. Not as a critic, but as a reader ready to follow where the ideas lead. That&rsquo;s the editing side now.</p><h2><a href=/posts/natural-conversations/>Natural conversations</a></h2><p>Feb 14, 2025</p><p>There&rsquo;s no perfect prompt, no perfect instruction, no perfect project spec. That&rsquo;s not where the work is done. The prompts are the sentences, the memos, the emails to the team along the way. When we talk to the human, we don&rsquo;t sit there to craft a perfect sentence before the words come out. We let them come out and we shape it how it comes, together in the conversation.</p><p>Real work is messy and undefined and unpredictable. Spending any time to craft a prompt is time wasted. We&rsquo;ve got it in our heads that they need a good prompt. With enough iterations, a long chain of two-word prompts will outdo an excellent and laborious 2-shot prompt. And you yourself as the operator will gather way more insights along the way than the two responses.</p><h2><a href=/posts/big-day/>Any day can be a big day</a></h2><p>Feb 11, 2025</p><p>I did something really cool today in building this website.</p><h2><a href=/posts/following-obsessions/>Following obsessions</a></h2><p>Feb 15, 2023</p><p>Knowing when is enough is the secret. There&rsquo;s different levels of obsessions, all concurrently pulling and influences us.</p><p>We find ourselves in the middle.</p></main><footer class=terminal-window><p>&copy; 2025 Pavel's Novel Thoughts</p></footer></div></body></html>
