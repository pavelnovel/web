And when you touch both the extremes and the core, you really are touching the whole thing and thus I was wholly me.</p><p>The second question was a challenge to not get stuck on one idea, one angle, one thought. There were always more thoughts coming around the corner. Ideas never come alone, they come together. If you&rsquo;re precious with one idea and don&rsquo;t let it breathe, you don&rsquo;t know what ideas it was coming with. So I let the weird flow, becoming a real audience to my own writing. Not as a critic, but as a reader ready to follow where the ideas lead. That&rsquo;s the editing side now.</p><p>Refining ideas. That&rsquo;s an insightful process, to come back to old ideas. It&rsquo;s like watching a movie again, knowing how it ended, so now you&rsquo;re just looking for more clues as you watch. Seeing what other hints you can pick up on, what other ideas snuck in while you weren&rsquo;t looking. The weird ones always find a way to hide in plain sight.</p></main><footer class=terminal-window><p>&copy; 2025 Pavel's Novel Thoughts</p></footer></div></body></html>
